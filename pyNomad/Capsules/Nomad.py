Nomad is a monad that can be used to chain functions together without
executing them. They will be executed when the monad is unwrapped.

This is useful for creating a call graph of functions that can be.
Nomads "Hunt" first and "Gather" later.
Hunting is the process of binding functions to the call graph, and establishing
a strategy for executing them. Gathering is the process of executing the call
graph according to the strategy.

Gather Mondads are the left shift operator, <<, and the gather method itself.
Hunt monads are the right shift operator, >>, and the hunt method itself.
