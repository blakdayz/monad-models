"""
Resilient Nomad Monads- Monad that can recover from errors
Supports async function chaining and call graph generation
with error recovery and alternative strategies, as well as
state signing for value corruption detection and recovery
from errors without having to re-execute the entire call graph,
as well as call graph generation for error recovery and debugging
both in the form of a string and a graphviz graph object at runtime,
as well as a method to generate a graph of the call graph.

Examples:
```python
from pyNomad.Containers.ResilientNomad import CampaignExecutorNomad
from pyNomad.ValueActors.Results import Encapsulate

async def go_to_sleep(x:str) -> str:
    return x.upper()

async def make_pretty(x:str) -> str:
    return x.replace(" ", "_")

async def make_loud_and_pretty_stars(x:str) -> str:
    return f"***{x.upper()}***"


async def make_filtered_quiet(filter:str) -> str:
    return x.replace(filter, "hello?....")

    def PrintSynch(x:str) -> str:
        print(x)

x = CampaignExecutorNomad("hello world!") >>
